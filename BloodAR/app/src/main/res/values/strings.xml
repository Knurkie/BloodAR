    <string name="atrial_fibrillation_description">Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart. A-fib increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.
        \n\nDuring atrial fibrillation, the heart\'s upper chambers (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly â€” out of sync with the lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart. For many people, A-fib may have no symptoms. However, A-fib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat (palpitations), shortness of breath or weakness.
        \n\nEpisodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. Although A-fib itself usually isn\'t life-threatening, it\'s a serious medical condition that requires proper treatment to prevent stroke.
        \n\nTreatment for atrial fibrillation may include medications, therapy to reset the heart rhythm and catheter procedures to block faulty heart signals.
        \n\nA person with atrial fibrillation may also have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. Although atrial flutter is a different arrhythmia, the treatment is quite similar to atrial fibrillation.</string>

    <string name="atherosclerosis_description">Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged with fatty substances called plaques, or atheroma.
        \n\nThese plaques cause the arteries to harden and narrow, restricting the blood flow and oxygen supply to vital organs, and increasing the risk of blood clots that could potentially block the flow of blood to the heart or brain.
        \n\nAtherosclerosis does not tend to have any symptoms at first and many people may be unaware they have it, but it can eventually cause life-threatening problems, such as heart attacks and strokes, if it gets worse.</string>
